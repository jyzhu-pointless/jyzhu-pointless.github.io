(The explanations below are mostly generated by ChatGPT and have not yet been manually reviewed. All terms will be carefully checked and polished soon. Please feel free to report any mistakes or suggestions.)

## A

- ***Aedes:*** A genus of mosquitoes including important disease vectors such as *Aedes aegypti*.  
- ***Anopheles:*** A genus of mosquitoes that transmit malaria, such as *Anopheles gambiae*.  

## C

- **Carrying capacity:** The maximum population size an environment can sustain.  
- **Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9):** An RNA-guided DNA endonuclease used in CRISPR systems to introduce site-specific cuts in the genome.
- **Chasing:** A dynamic where wild-type individuals escape suppression spatially and recolonize.  
- **Confinement:** The restriction of a gene drive to a defined spatial area.  
- **CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats):** A genome editing system that enables targeted DNA cleavage and repair.  
- ***Culex:*** A genus of mosquitoes including *Culex quinquefasciatus*, a vector of various viruses.  

## D

- **Daisy-chain drive:** A self-exhausting gene drive system composed of multiple linked elements.  
- **Density-dependent competition:** Competition intensity increases with population density.  
- **Deterministic model:** A model where population outcomes are fully determined by parameters.  
- **Discrete-generation model:** A model assuming non-overlapping generations.  
- **Drive conversion (Drive efficiency):** The rate at which a drive allele converts its wild-type counterpart.  
- **Drosophila melanogaster:** A model organism widely used in genetics and drive research.  

## E

- **Effective population size ($N_e$):** The size of an idealized population with equivalent genetic drift.  
- **Embryo resistance formation (maternal deposition):** Resistance generated by maternal Cas9 deposition.  
- **End-joining repair (NHEJ):** A DNA repair pathway that often produces mutations at cut sites.  
- **Invasion threshold:** Minimum initial drive frequency required for spread.  

## F

- **Fecundity:** The number of offspring produced per female.  
- **Fertility:** The ability to produce viable offspring.  
- **Fitness:** The relative reproductive success of a genotype.  
- **Fraction-based model:** A population model using allele frequencies rather than individuals.  
- **Functional resistance (*r1*) allele:** Resistance alleles that preserve gene function while blocking the drive.  

## G

- **Gene drive:** A genetic system that biases inheritance to increase allele frequency in a population.  
- **Genetic drift:** Random changes in allele frequency due to sampling effects.  
- **Genetic load:** Reduction in population fitness due to deleterious alleles.  
- **Germline resistance formation:** Resistance mutations occurring during germline repair.  
- **gRNA (guide RNA):** An RNA molecule that guides Cas9 to a specific DNA target sequence for cleavage.

## H

- **Haploinsufficient (haplolethal):** A gene where one functional copy is insufficient for viability.  
- **Haplosufficient (recessive lethal):** A gene where heterozygotes are viable but homozygotes are lethal.  
- **Heterozygote advantage:** Heterozygotes have higher fitness than homozygotes.  
- **Homing drive:** A CRISPR-based drive that cuts and copies itself via HDR.  
- **Homology-directed repair (HDR):** A high-fidelity repair mechanism using a homologous template.  

## I

- **Individual-based model:** A model that tracks each organism and its genotype explicitly.  

## L

- **Low-density growth rate:** Population growth rate when density is close to zero, where density-dependent competition can be neglected.  

## M

- **Mendelian inheritance:** Standard 50% allele transmission to offspring.  
- **Meiosis:** The process of cell division in sexually reproducing organisms that produces gametes (sperm or eggs) with half the chromosome number of the parent, allowing genetic recombination and inheritance.  
- **Migration rate:** The proportion of individuals moving between populations per generation.  

## N

- **Nonfunctional resistance (*r2*) allele:** Resistance alleles that disrupt gene function.  

## O

- **Overlapping-generation model:** A model where individuals of different ages coexist.  

## P

- **Panmictic model:** A model assuming random mating across the entire population.  
- **Population modification:** Drives aiming to alter but not suppress populations.  
- **Population suppression:** Drives designed to reduce or eliminate populations.  
- **Promoter:** DNA element controlling expression of Cas9 or gRNA.  

## R

- **Release of insects carrying dominant lethal alleles (RIDL):** A genetic control strategy using sterile insects.  
- **Rescue element:** A gene component that restores viability to individuals carrying a drive.  
- **Resistance allele:** A mutation preventing the drive from cutting or copying.  

## S

- **Self-sustaining drive:** A drive that can persist and spread indefinitely once released.  
- **Self-limiting drive:** A drive designed to fade out after several generations.  
- **Sexual selection:** Differential mating success based on genotype or phenotype.  
- **SLiM:** A forward genetic simulation framework for population modeling.  
- **Spatial model:** A model incorporating spatial structure or movement.  
- **Stochastic model:** A model incorporating randomness in reproduction or migration.  

## T

- **Target site:** DNA sequence recognized and cleaved by Cas9/gRNA.  
- **Threshold-dependent drive:** A drive that spreads only above a certain frequency.  
- **Toxin-antidote drive:** A system that targets and disrupts an essential gene while also providing rescue via a recoded version of the target, including designs such as TARE, TADE, TADS, etc.  
- **Cleavage rate:** Success rate of target DNA cleavage.  

## U

- **Underdominance drive:** A drive where heterozygotes have lower fitness than homozygotes.  

## V

- **Vector-borne disease:** Diseases transmitted by organisms such as mosquitoes.  
- **Viability:** The ability of individuals to survive to reproductive age.  

## W

- ***Wolbachia:*** A maternally transmitted bacterium affecting host reproduction.  
- **Wright–Fisher model:** A discrete-generation genetic drift model with constant population size.
